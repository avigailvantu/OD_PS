Open data for Public Spaces 


Today, programming and web tools are used in many fields and industries: to build technologies, visualize and analyze data. For public spaces, these tools have many benefits and allow scaling up the understanding of urban morphology, municipal services, residentsâ€™ perceptions and the urban infrastructure. Although in many cases some training is required to work with these tools, in the long term these enable saving time and deriving deeper understanding about the urban environment.
